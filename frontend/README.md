# Front End
## TOOLS INSTALL

In Docker Compose setup, the frontend service is using the nginx:alpine image, which is based on Alpine Linux, a lightweight Linux distribution. If you need to install additional tools like the faas-cli (Function as a Service CLI) into your nginx container, please go the the dockerfile to add specific requirements.

### Faas-cli

To test if faas-cli is installed in your Docker container, you can execute a command within the running container that checks the version or help menu of faas-cli. Here's how you can do it:

First, find out the name or ID of the running frontend container by using the docker ps command:

```sh

docker ps
```
Look for your frontend container in the list and note its container ID or name.

Next, use docker exec to run faas-cli inside that container:

```sh
docker exec <container_name_or_id> faas-cli version
```
or

```sh
docker exec <container_name_or_id> faas-cli --help
```

Replace <container_name_or_id> with the actual container name or ID you found with docker ps.

If faas-cli is correctly installed, these commands should return the version information or the help menu of the faas-cli. If the tool is not found, you will receive an error message indicating that the command is not recognized or does not exist.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
